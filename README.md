# [Reanalysis] Metapangenomics of pulque fermentation reanalysis
Reanalysis of metagenomes from pulque fermentation implementing metapangenomics.

### Microbial populations in pulque
Traditional fermented food has been produced worldwide for thousands of years for cultural, nutritional and religous purposes. Different substrates, production conditions and microorganisms are responsible for the characteristic flavors and metabolite profiles that make each fermented product unique. Evaluation of microbial population structures in fermented food is key to understand how selection and habitat adaptation occurs. Pulque, a traditional fermented beverage from Mexico, is produced by the fermentation of agave sap in an open batch-like bioreactor. Pulque production starts by the spontaneous incoorporation of environmental microorganisms to agave sap collected within the agave plant. Thus,  Inspecting the genomic diversity at the population level is key to understand the impact of microbial populations within production of fermented food. Metapangenomics, has been successfully applied to assess habitat adaptation and evolution of microbial populations in multiple environments. The current respository
