# Metapangenomics of pulque fermentation reanalysis
Reanalysis of metagenomes from pulque fermentation implementing metapangenomics.

### Microbial populations in pulque
Traditional fermented food has been produced for thousands of years for cultural, nutritional and religous purposes. Pulque is a traditional fermented beverage from Mexico that has been produced since before the colonization of America. Its production has remained mostly unchanged throughout time and relies on microorganisms inoculating directly from the environment - knows as spontaneous fermentation. This beverage is characterized by haveing a high alcolholic content (~20%), being viscous, slightly bitter and carbonated. Microbial composition suggests

Typically alcoholic, lactic acid, and aceti acid fermentations are recognized as the most common proccesses in food ferments. However, metabolic analysis suggest a high complex network of processess ocurring during .
